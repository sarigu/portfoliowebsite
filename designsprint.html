        <h2>about the task</h2>
        <p>
            The assignment was to develop a prototype of an improved Fronter implementing Keas goals and feature wishes.     
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <p>We teamed up in groups to do a five day sprint.</p>
            <h3>Day 1: map</h3>
            <p>
                Based on our experience with Fronter and the 
                user research from last week, we decided to make 
                „Tailoring communication to students“ our end goal. We focused on texting fellow students 
                and groups. 
              
            </p>
            <p>Step 1: Go to Fronter and log in</p>
            <p> Step 2: Open the communication-room</p>
            <p>Step 3: Send a one or multiple student an invite to chat</p>
            <p>Step 4: Write messages back and forth in the chat </p>
            <p>       In the chatroom the students can add/remove members (for group chats), share files, 
                    see which messages are read/open by the others and get notifications about newly 
                    incoming messages.<br><br></p>
            <h3>Day 2: sketch</h3>

            <h3>Day 3: decide</h3>
            <img id="sprintDecide" src="images/large/designsprintDecide.jpg">
           <h3>Day 4: prototype</h3>
           <h4>The design</h4>
           <p>I used the KEA logo and the colors one can find in the offial kea design guide. 
               The colors are used for example for backgrounds printed and graphical elements like tables and boxes.
               I also got inspired by the printed KEA brochures
           </p>
           <h4>interactive prototype</h4>
           <p>This is the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/1583c508-613d-4da9-581a-46d4630a41b8-63b2/?fullscreen&hints=off" target="blank"> the prototype</a> we campe up with on the fourth day of the sprint.<br><br></p>
           <h3>Day 5: user test</h3>
           <p>For the interview we picked one of the prototypes and prepared some questions.</p>
           <p>Questions to welcome the expert:</p>
           <ul>
                <li>Could you introduce yourself?</li>
                <li>How familiar are you with Fronter?</li>    
            </ul>
            <p>Tasks to solve while thinking out loud:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find todays schedule</li>
                <li>Write a new message to a group</li>   
                <li>Submit an assigment for this week</li> 
                <li>Find the newest message from a fellow student</li>
                <li>Find the newest teachers message</li>
                <li>What do you expect when you click on the burgermenu, mail icon, bell icon?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Questions for the expert to answer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Was the navigation of the app useful?</li>
                <li>Do you think there were some features missing?</li>   
                <li>Do you think that there are some features on Fronter we didn’t have?</li> 
                <li>Were you in doubt of anything?</li>
                <li>Are there any features you wouldn’t use and which ones?</li>
                <li>How was it?/How do you feel?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We talked to 5 MMD students and got helpful feedback. We took all the suggestions in consideration. For the future we would like to add a back button, make new incoming messages more visible and make finding students/teachers one haven’t chat
            to yet easier. We would also talk about how we could organise the content 
            differently so it fits the expectations a user has better.

            <h2>What I have learned</h2>
            <p>Besides exercising my XD skills, I learned a couple of new things.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How a design sprint works and what can be done in a week</li>
                <li>How tough it is to incorporate users’ needs, usage situations and a clients nedds and goals in a design solution</li>
                <li>How a user interface can influence an user experience</li>
                <li>We also conducted user tests at the end. I learned how many information can be gathered by just observing the tester during the interview or having the tester think out loud as well as by having the right questions prepared. 
                </li>
