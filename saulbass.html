        <h2>about the task</h2>
        <p>The assignment was to create a responsive website. 
            The website as well as the design should be based on a given style. 
            As we worked on a mobile version of the website berforehand we were 
            told to add grid layouts, media queries and other elements to it to turn 
            it into a website, that can be accessed from multiple devices. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="process">
            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <h3>The design</h3>
            <p>My given style was Saul Bass' Organic Design. I began 
            the project by researching the given style and generate ideas from it. This is what the final product looks like.

            <h4>Font</h4>
            <p>I used a san serif font with wide 
                and crooked letters, which creates a cut out/handemade feel. 
                When used with only capital letters it resembles the font often 
                find on posters made by Saul Bass. 
            </p>
           <br>
            <h4>Colors</h4>
            <p>
                One can find a simple use of color in Organic Design. 
                One bold and vivid color was used for backgrounds, negative space and/or lettering, 
                whereas black and whites are often used for the simple shapes and/or lettering.
            </p>
            <img id="saulbassColors" src="images/large/saulbassColors.jpg">
            <h4>Images with backgrounds</h4>
            <p>
                The decision of colors is influenced by colors used in renown posters (see above). 
                I added the shapes to to give it a paper cut out feel.   
            </p>
            <img id="saulbassImgBackgrounds" src="images/large/saulbassImgBackgrounds.jpg">
            <h4>Logo</h4>
            <p>
                The logo relates to the domainname: Guckiemonster (a combination of the „cookiemonster“ and 
                the fact that people tend to misread my surname „Guci“ as „Guckie)“.
                The monstereye coming out of a hole represents curiosity. The letters are inspired by cookies.
            </p>

            <h4>Banner</h4>
            <p>
                    Since Saul Bass did a lot of movie posters and film credits, 
                    I wanted to introduce a feature that looks like a very simple version of a usual „organic design“ - posters. 
                    I added crooked lines, a white outline, a bold color and an organic font.
